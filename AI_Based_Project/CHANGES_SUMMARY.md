## 📝 Notes

### PDF Generation:
- **Primary Method**: WeasyPrint (recommended, better quality)
- **Fallback 1**: xhtml2pdf (if WeasyPrint unavailable)
- **Fallback 2**: Markdown file (if both PDF generators fail)

### WeasyPrint Installation:
On some systems, you may need additional dependencies:
- **Windows**: Usually works out of the box
- **Linux**: May need `libpango` and `libcairo`
- **macOS**: May need `cairo` and `pango`

If WeasyPrint installation fails, the system will automatically use xhtml2pdf as fallback.

1. ✅ **Competitor Analysis**: Now included in all reports (Full & Quick)
2. ✅ **Full Display**: Reports show completely without truncation
3. ✅ **PDF Download**: Reports download as PDF files with professional styling

The system is backward compatible - if PDF generation fails, it falls back to markdown download.
